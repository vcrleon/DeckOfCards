# DeckOfCards -- Making the network calls went well, but I had an issue with the images displaying in the recycler view. I logged the network response to make sure I was in fact getting back the objects, and that was successful. I was able to implement a majority of the test, but got stuck on the last step due to the images not displaying in the recycler view. I lost time trying to figure out why the images weren't displaying and couldn't go back to add/fix a few more required details like setting up an error message wheneve the user left the edit text blank or setting up a new deck of cards whenever the user started the app. The exam was fair and I didn't come across any major issues.
